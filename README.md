# Node Express Starter

This is a simple but complete boilerplate for a NodeJS REST API app using ExpressJS, validation with [Joi](https://joi.dev/), caching with [Redis](https://redis.io/), and backed by a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

## Get started

You will need to have Docker and NodeJS installed. Run `docker-compose up -d`. This will start Postgres, Redis and the Node app.

You will need to run the script to create the database and required tables. Run `yarn createdb`.

Then open up your favourite endpoint testing tool like Postman or Insomnia, and start hitting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Application structure

There is clear separation between app layers to make code navigation a breeze.

Router -> Controller -> Service -> Persistence.

**Routers** define middleware and final functions in the pipeline.

**Controllers** orchestrate the rest of the call-graph. They can call into multiple services and components. They do not throw errors, but rather pass custom `Error`s to a controller-level error handler. They are the only point beyond routers that send responses to clients.

**Services** do the domain-specific work, perform any data transformations, and can call the persistence layer as well as trigger any events.

**Persistence** is solely to save to a data store. It will have to do any required sanitization of input as well.

```
Client --> Router --> Controller --> ServiceA --> PersistenceA
                                \
                                 \ --> ServiceB --> PersistenceB
```

## Tokens

The app has 2 types of tokens. **Access Tokens** and **Refresh Tokens**.

Access tokens are required on every request (except when signing in/up) as a header `"Authorization": "Bearer ..."`.

The **Access Token** has an expiry. When it expires, the client is expected to use the **Refresh Token** to generate a new **Access Token** for subsequent requests.

Upon signup, signin or refresh, the client will receive both an access and a refresh tokens:

```json
{
  "tokens": {
    "access_token": "...",
    "refresh_token": "..."
  }
}
```

## Database ORM

This app uses `pg` drivers rather than a standard ORM. This means, yes, you have to write your own SQL, but if you don't know SQL, maybe you should't be interacting with an SQL database :)

You might be asking, "why not Prisma? It's the new hotness!". Well, it certainly does have a lot of stars on GitHub, but it also has a lot of issues on GitHub too. At the time of writing this, it's around 2.6k, which is a lot. There's also [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) which I have used heavily in the past, but I'm not a fan of creating Sequelize-specific models to manage the shape of data. It's quite heavily tied to the ORM, rather than the actual data.

So I decided to go with something more "stable" and barebones. Old and boring may not be cool, but it works predictably most of the time.
